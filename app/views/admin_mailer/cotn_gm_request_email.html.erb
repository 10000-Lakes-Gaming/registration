  <p><b>Hello <%= @message.user&.name %>,</b></p>

  <p>There comes a time in a Minnesotan gamer's year when the distant sounds of dice rattling in the Scandinavian
    Ballroom at the Crown Plaza in Plymouth Minnesota reaches their ears! It is the time that they realize that Con of
    the North, the longest running games convention in Minnesota, is coming soon! This event will be a "Premier Plus"
    event, allowing GMs and players to accrue additional ACP.</p>

  <p>All the excitement will be for naught without the help of our volunteers; we will need <b>your</b> help to make
    this year a success.</p>

  <p>Volunteering for Con of the North requires a two-step process; first, register for Con of the North at
    <a href="https://tabletop.events/conventions/con-of-the-north-2023">their
      registration website</a>. When registering, make sure you register as a Judge, if you're both playing and
    volunteering, or as a Referee if you're only running games. The cost of a Judge badge for the convention is
    currently $30, rising to $40 after December 31 2022. While a Referee badge is only $2, be advised that if you
    register as a Referee but later register to play games at the convention, you will have to buy a full Judge badge at
    the convention site.</p>

  <p>Once you've registered for the convention, head to
    <a href="<%= event_url(@message.event) %>">the MNPOP registration
      app</a> and sign up for Con of the North 2023 tables there. All of our
    scheduled tables are listed at the registration site for Pathfinder Society, and we track our table GMs there
    throughout the convention. Tables listed on the registration app are looking for GMs; these have already been
    submitted as events to Con of the North and uploaded to their registration site. If you would like to request a
    scenario not currently on the schedule, please contact 10,000 Lakes Gaming with the name of the scenario and the
    time slot you would like to run the scenario in; we will work with you and the Con of the North staff to update
    their registration site as well as ours.</p>


  <p>As in years past, MN-POP will provide copies of chronicles and will be supplying water and throat lozenges during
    each convnetion slot to our table GMs.</p>

  <p>Thank you for volunteering! We cannot do this without you!</p>
