<h1>SkålCon Registration Reminder!</h1>

<h2>Register for SkålCon!</h2>
<p>If you haven't done so already, please go onto
  <a href="https://pfs-registration.herokuapp.com/">MSP PFS Registration</a>, and click the goldenrod "Register" button for SkålCon to register for the event! Creating an account on the MSP PFS Registration application does not register you for the event. Cost for registration is $20 online, but goes up to $25 at the door, so get in early to save $5! Until you have paid (and been confirmed by our volunteers, which can take up to 24 hours to process) you will not be able to sign up for sessions.</p>

<h2>GMs still needed!</h2>
<p>We can still use several GMs in all slots! If you are interested, please volunteer by adding your full name to a slot
  on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kKR-Z0WPtOpWJhYtGwaDQog29E6PhJ5CkvUD_QB6fqY/edit">GM Volunteer
  spreadsheet</a>. It is only through the generosity of our volunteer GMs that we can successful!</p>

<h2>Donations accepted!</h2>
<p>If you would like to donate something for either the silent auction or the raffle, please let us know by going to <a href="https://pfs-registration.herokuapp.com/contact">our contact page</a> and selecting 'I have something to donate!' in the dropdown. Someone will contact you to arrange for your donation.</p>

<p>Thank you for making this convention a success!</p>
