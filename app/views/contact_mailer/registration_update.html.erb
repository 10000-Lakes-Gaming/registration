        <p>Weâ€™ll be having a Supply Drive for Tubman, as we do every year. And we do mean supplies â€“ many of the items

          <a href="https://www.tubman.org/give-help/ways-to-give/donate-goods.html">donation page</a>
          on their website. Get some items to bring, and weâ€™ll give you some stars for your SkalCon badge!
          What do the stars get you? In-game benefits! Your GM will know whatâ€™s up. ðŸ™‚</p>

        <div><b>Auction/Raffle Item Donation</b></div>

        <p>Have some gently-used RPG gear that you donâ€™t want anymore? Happen to have some tickets of some kind youâ€™d
          like to donate to a good cause? SkalCon can take those off your hands!</p>

        <p>Our auction and raffle is stocked, in part, by attendees donating something cool they think others would
          like.
          If you have an item you think fits the bill, email
          <a href="mailto:contact@skalcon.org">contact@skalcon.org</a>
          with the details and weâ€™ll be in touch!
          Item donations are tax deductible as well! Just ask for a donation receipt and we will provide.</p>
