  <h2>Volunteer Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Even if you have volunteered previously, please read through this section thoroughly as instructions may have
      changed some from previous conventions. it anyway as some things have changed. If this is your first time
      volunteering, these guidelines will help answer your questions and guide you through this important part of Paizo
      Organized Play.
    </li>
    <li>As a volunteer, you are the eyes, ears, face, and voice of Paizo. We expect each of you to maintain a positive
      attitude, professional behavior, and good hygiene.
    </li>
    <li>The Player Boon token rolls remain the same. 10% chance per token turned in, 5 tokens max per roll. Winners roll
      randomly on which boon received. GM boons can be claimed when turning in your first session reporting sheet.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <hr>


  <h2>Logistics:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Each GM is responsible to provide their own maps, miniatures, handouts, and scenario-specific pre-generated
      characters (if your scenario requires them such as in Serpent's Ire).
    </li>
    <li>Each GM is responsible for having a reliable copy of the scenario they are running. Power outlets are scarce
      in the room so GMs must have a backup option in case their computer or tablet runs out of power.
      For safety reasons, we cannot allow extension cords to be run across the room.
    </li>
    <li>Chronicles and session reporting sheets will be provided.</li>
    <li>The HQ has a supply of New Player Packets and pre-generated iconic characters (this does not include scenario-specific
      pre-generated characters, such as in Serpent's Ire).
    </li>
    <li>Do not leave your assigned table until HQ has released or reassigned you. HQ may assign you to additional tasks.</li>
    <li>No personal items may be left in the HQ area.</li>
    <li>The convention room will be closed to all players 30 minutes prior to the the running of interactive specials
      for the GM pre-special meeting. All GMâ€™s running the specials are expected to be at this meeting, and should
      report at least 30 minutes prior to the session start time. Please be on time, as we will be discussing signaling
      and the like.
    </li>
  </ul>
