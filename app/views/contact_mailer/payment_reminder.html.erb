<p>It has come to our attention, that you have registered for <%= @event.name %>, but have not paid.</p>

<p>Participation in <%= @event.name %>  costs <%= number_to_currency(@event.prereg_price) %><% if @event.early_bird_discount? %>,
   but after <%= @event.prereg_ends.localtime.to_formatted_s(:long_ordinal) %>
      the price will go up to <%= number_to_currency @event.onsite_price %><% end %>. Payment allows you to sign up for the
  games you wish to play, as well as opens up the ability to purchase premium tickets if they exist. All participants,
  whether players, game masters, or headquarters staff, are required to pay for their registration.</p>

<p>
  To pay for <%= @event.name %> and sign up for your games, please go to <%= link_to "#{@event.name}", @event %>, and
  click on the "Pay With Card" button. If you are unable to pay with a credit card, please click on "Contact Us!" and
  select "I cannot pay with a credit card" to ask for arrangements to be made for a cash payment. A representative of
  <%= @event.name %> and 10,000 Lakes Gaming will be in touch with you.
</p>

<p>If you have already paid for your <%= @event.name %> registration, please feel free to ignore this message.</p>

<p>Thank you for making this convention a success!</p>
