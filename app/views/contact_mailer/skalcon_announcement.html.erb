  <h1>The physical SkålCon 2020 convention is cancelled.</h1>

  <p>We realize many of you were looking forward to this event. However, with the COVID-19 pandemic still ongoing, it
    would be immensely difficult for us to hold a safe convention for our volunteers and attendees given the nature of
    gaming conventions (i.e. sitting in the same room for 12+ hours in a day in relative close proximity with other
    people).</p>

  <p>SkålCon 2021 will be held September 24th - 26th 2021 at the Crowne Plaza Minneapolis West. We hope that the effects
    of the pandemic will be mitigated by then!</p>

  <p>But we still need your help! We’d love to bring our community together online, to meet (at a distance) and to raise
    donations for Tubman like we do every year. To better assess how to hold an online event that meets these goals, we
    need YOU to please take
    <%= link_to 'this survey', 'https://forms.gle/cxwHbSZZ1DM4c2a1A' %>
    We have some simple questions about the types of programming an online event would have and will help determine if
    we have enough interest in an online Skalcon event this year!</p>
