      <h2>Player Information for Online Games</h2>
      <p>Below are some helpful suggestions for making your online gaming experience more enjoyable.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You should see links to all of your games on your schedule, both in this email, and on the registration
          site.
          On each of these pages you should see the following:
          <ul>
            <li>The type of Virutal Table Top (VTT) the GM is using. (such as Roll20 or Foundry)</li>
            <li>A link to their VTT, and the name of the game, if applicable. If you can, please sign in to the VTT
              as soon as possible, so that you can get your character into the game.<br>
              <strong>Note for Fantasy Grounds:</strong> You will need to download the demo or have a copy and then use
              the server alias to log in when the gm has the game up.
            </li>
            <li>A link to the GM's sign-in sheet. This replaces the physical sign in sheet we use in a face-to-face
              convention.
            </li>
            <li>The name of the discord voice and text channels that this game will be using on the
              <a class="ul" target="_blank" href="<%= @event.chat_server_url %>"><%= @event.chat_server %></a> chat
              server. Voice and text chanels will have the same name, and please report in to both by the start of your
              session.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If a GM does not have this information, please let headquarters know in the <code>#headquarters</code>
          channel
          of <a class="ul" target="_blank" href="<%= @event.chat_server_url %>"><%= @event.chat_server %></a></li>
        <li>GMs will have pregenerated iconic characters available for all games that are in tier for pregens.</li>
        <li>GMs will be emailing you your chronicles. However, they may not always be able to get it to you before the
          next session, but you will still be able to play your character.
        </li>
        <li>If you do not receive your chronicle by the end of the next (non-quest) session (example, you played FRI12,
          so by the end of the FRI19 session), please let headquarters know in the <code>#headquasters</code> chat
          channel
        </li>
        <li>Boons and gift vouchers.
          <ul>
            <li>Boons and vouchers will be randomly assigned by headquarters for each session.</li>
            <li>For PFS1 and Starfinder, 1 out of 10 players for a campaign in the sessions will win a boon.</li>
            <li>For PFS2, you will receive ACP, and we expect this to be at a "premier plus" level!</li>
            <li>Vouchers will be distributed at random between all players and GMs of a particular session.<br>
              In all cases, these will be emailed to the email that you have registered with on the application.
            </li>
            <li>If you need to have this updated, please reply to this email, asking for your email to be updated.</li>
            <li>We are still determining how we will be handling Charity Boons.</li>

      <h2>Characters and Virtual Table Tops.</h2>
      <h3>Roll20</h3>
      <p>For Roll20, we are providing "character builder" games in Roll20.
        You can access these by going to the <code>#character-creation-stations</code> at
        <a class="ul" target="_blank" href="<%= @event.chat_server_url %>"><%= @event.chat_server %></a>
        and viewing the pinned messages. There should be plenty of blank character sheets for you to use, though you
        can ask for help in the channel. These are available now. We are asking all GMs to allow exports from your
        vault into their game. However, bear in mind, that not all GMs will have paid accounts, and if they do not, they
        will not be able to accept your premade character sheet.

      <h3>Fantasy Grounds</h3>
      <p>If you are looking to create a character on Fantasy Grounds, please @ <code>Aerine
        #8215</code> on any channel at
        <a class="ul" target="_blank" href="<%= @event.chat_server_url %>"><%= @event.chat_server %></a> and she will
        work with you to set up your character.</p>

      <h3>Foundry</h3>
      <p>We are still working with the GMs running on Foundry to set up times for character sheet building. If you are
        signed up for one of these tables, we will be sending you an additional email soon.</p>

      <h3>Google Slides or Docs</h3>
      <p>Typically GMs running on slides or docs will not be using any particular character sheet. However, please have
        your character sheet available in a digital format. </p>
