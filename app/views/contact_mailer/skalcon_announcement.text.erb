SkalCon Online Registration Is Officially Open!

It’s happening - SkalCon Online Registration is open!

Just log onto the registration.skalcon.org site to register for the event, taking
place October 9th - 11th 2020! SkalCon Online has a suggested donation of $10.00,
but you can choose your donation amount to be what you are comfortable with. As always,
proceeds from SkalCon will go directly to Tubman.

At this time, only people volunteering to GM can sign up for events on the schedule.
Remember, GMs choose the Virtual Table Top system they would prefer to use - so don’t
be afraid to GM! SkalCon organizers will offer support for setting up your games, as well.

After GMs have some time to get signed up for their tables, we announce when player
sign-ups will be turned on. However, you don’t have to wait until then to get
registered for the convention and plan your schedule.

Keep an eye out for our special guest tables! Our special guests this year include
Organized Play Manager Tonya Wondridge, Starfinder Society Developer Thurston Hillman,
Organized Play Associate Alex Speidel, and authors Kate Baker, Dennis Muldoon,
Jenny Jarzabski, and Vanessa Hoskins.

SkalCon Online will be coordinating using Discord, so be sure to join the 10,000 Lakes
Gaming Discord before the convention (and watch us build out our channel functionality
in real time!)

We look forward to virtual games with all of you!
