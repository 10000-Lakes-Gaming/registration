Dear Pathfinders and Starfinders,

Con of the North is February 18-20 2022, and we're looking for GM volunteers!
We are running over 90 tables over the weekend, so we appreciate you taking the time to GM for us.

Con of the North requires proof of COVID-19 vaccination and masks.

To register for Con of the North itself, please go to the
  Con of the North registration site at https://tabletop.events/conventions/con-of-the-north-2022.:
  Early bird registration price ends Dec 31st. There is a "referee only" badge for $2, but but remember this will
  not allow you to play should your table fold.

To sign-up as to GM, please register on our <%=@event.name  %> registration site and pick out the sessions you'd like to GM:
  <%= event_url(@event) %>

We'll be running the PFS2 special 3-99 Fate in the Future Saturday afternoon, and the linked SFS special 3-99
  Perils of the Past on Saturday evening! Remember these are replayable, but only in a different tier. So if you played
  Fate in the Future at Sk√•lCon at level 5, you can play it again with a level 1-4 character! The same is true for
  Perils of the Past! Play them both for the full story!

You can view the schedule in spreadsheet format here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BTOW4aNy0gK6mStIknWOdgCsY0QrwljUIh5_d65-rCo/edit?usp=sharing

Let us know if you have any questions, and thanks for making our local conventions great!

Thanks!

Minnesota Paizo Organized Play (MN-POP) and 10,000 Lakes Gaming
