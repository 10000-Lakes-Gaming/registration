Finally, a reminder for our in-person attendees that the COVID-19 policy is in effect. You can read the full policy here: http://www.skalcon.org/covid-19-statement/ Be sure to bring a copy of your vaccination card or similar vaccine record if you are headed to the hotel.

COVID-19 Policy

Our COVID-19 policy applies to all who are in our hotel conference rooms at SkålCon ‘21.
“Attendees” in this policy refers to those who will be in the hotel conference rooms.

1. Attendees must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.
   a. This policy is not subject to change.
   b. “Fully vaccinated” means you are at least 2 weeks past the final dose of the vaccine you received.
   c. Proof of vaccination must be presented at HQ when registering or picking up your badge at the convention.
     i. Allowable formats include:
       - A photocopy of your CDC vaccination card;
       - a high-quality photo/scan of your CDC vaccination card;
       - an international equivalent;
       - printed record of your vaccination from a Doctor’s office, etc.
     ii. If you forget your vaccination record, we will be forced to assume you are not vaccinated and cannot participate at in-person convention activities.

2. Masks will be required at the convention. This policy may be relaxed closer to the date depending on CDC, state, and local government guidelines.
3. Attendees are asked not to eat food while in the convention space, due to masking. Drinks are allowed.
4. Attendees are asked not to attend if they are ill.
5. Attendees are asked to respect social distancing when not at their tables.
6. Attendees can wear provided wristbands to represent their comfort level when it comes to physical contact.
  - Red – do not touch, maintain distance
  - Yellow – some contact allowed, such as elbow bumps instead of handshakes
  - Green – hugs and handshakes are allowed, with consent
