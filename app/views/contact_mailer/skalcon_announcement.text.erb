Dear Pathfinders and Starfinders,

Con of the North is February 18-20 2022, and we need your help GMing Pathfinder and Starfinder.
We are planning over 90 tables over the weekend, so we appreciate you taking the time to GM for us.
Unfortunately, we have only about a third of our tables covered with GMs, and neither special currently
has enough GMs to make them happen.

Without your help, we will have to cancel a large number of our planned tables, and will also have to cancel both
the Pathfinder and Starfinder specials! Please volunteer to run a table or three so that we can avoid doing this. GMs
get their scenarios for free and increased ACP on tables that they run!

- Con of the North requires proof of COVID-19 vaccination and wearing of masks in all convention spaces.
- Drinking is not allowed in any Con of the North convention areas, including the MN-POP room.
- "Goblin grenades" and "skitterbombs" will not be allowed at Con of the North. All games will be run as written.

To register for Con of the North itself, please go to the
  Con of the North registration site at https://tabletop.events/conventions/con-of-the-north-2022.:
  There is a "referee only" badge for $2, but please remember this will not allow you to play should your table fold.

To sign-up as to GM, please register on our <%=@event.name  %> registration site and pick out the sessions you'd like to GM:
  <%= event_url(@event) %>

If we get enough GMs to run six(6) tables each, we will be running the PFS2 special 3-99 Fate in the Future Saturday afternoon, and the linked SFS special 3-99
  Perils of the Past on Saturday evening! Remember these are replayable, but only in a different tier. So if you played
  Fate in the Future at Sk√•lCon at level 5, you can play it again with a level 1-4 character! The same is true for
  Perils of the Past! Play them both for the full story!

You can view the schedule in spreadsheet format here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BTOW4aNy0gK6mStIknWOdgCsY0QrwljUIh5_d65-rCo/edit?usp=sharing

Let us know if you have any questions, and thanks for making our local conventions great!

Thank you for helping out!
