Greetings!

It’s almost time for the main event - SkalCon is happening October 29th-31st! (Spooky!) With the convention less than two weeks away, our pre-registration will close on October 24th. Head on over to the registration website if you haven’t registered yet for either in-person or online games. https://pfs-registration.herokuapp.com/events/17 . The at-con pricing will be $30 instead of the $25 pricing pre-registration is. Remember, as always, your registration fee helps to support our charity, Tubman!

Once you’re registered, don’t forget to sign up for games! There are plenty of tables with GMs waiting to run a game for you (and your friends? :) )  If you’re procrastinating on setting up your schedule, just take a minute right now and pick out a few tables. We are running the PFS2 3-99 multi-table special on Friday night and the SFS 3-99 multi-table special on Friday night. Both are offered in person and online!

We’ll have a full guide on what to expect when you arrive at SkalCon posted on our website (skalcon.org) next week - but don’t forget to bring some physical items to donate to Tubman and/or a local food bank. Information on what Tubman is accepting for donations is here: https://www.tubman.org/give-help/ways-to-give/donate-goods.html We’ll also accept items for our silent auction at the convention if you have something to donate on that front.
