      <div class="card-text">
        <p>Besides attending SkalCon, there are some other ways you can help make this event super
          successful â€“ physical donations! We accept donations for our auction and raffle â€“ and more importantly, for
          Tubman! Letâ€™s get some more details so you know what to bring with you to SkalCon!
        </p>
        <h3>Supply Drive for Tubman</h3>

        <p>Weâ€™ll be having a Supply Drive for Tubman, as we do every year. And we do mean supplies â€“ many of the items
          on
          <a href="https://tubman.org/file_download/b8f9d4f2-c099-4a98-b3f1-ebcb4bea9a5d">Tubmanâ€™s donation wish
            list</a>
          are everyday products a family needs, like soaps, snack bags, and diapers.</p>

        <p>Please look at their
          <a href="https://tubman.org/file_download/b8f9d4f2-c099-4a98-b3f1-ebcb4bea9a5d">official donation wish
            list</a>
          and their
          <a href="https://www.tubman.org/give-help/ways-to-give/donate-goods.html">donation page</a>
          on their website. Get some items to bring, and weâ€™ll give you some stars for your SkalCon badge!
          What do the stars get you? In-game benefits! Your GM will know whatâ€™s up. ðŸ™‚</p>

        <h3>Auction/Raffle Item Donation</h3>

        <p>Have some gently-used RPG gear that you donâ€™t want anymore? Happen to have some tickets of some kind youâ€™d
          like to donate to a good cause? SkalCon can take those off your hands!</p>

        <p>Our auction and raffle is stocked, in part, by attendees donating something cool they think others would
          like.
          If you have an item you think fits the bill, email <a mailto="contact@skalcon.org">contact@skalcon.org</a>
          with the details and weâ€™ll be in touch!
          Item donations are tax deductible as well! Just ask for a donation receipt and we will provide.</p>
