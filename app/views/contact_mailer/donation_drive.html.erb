        <p>Besides attending SkalCon, there are some other ways you can help make this event super
          successful – physical donations! We accept donations for our auction and raffle – and more importantly, for
          Tubman! Let’s get some more details so you know what to bring with you to SkalCon!
        </p>
        <h3>Supply Drive for Tubman</h3>

        <p>We’ll be having a Supply Drive for Tubman, as we do every year. And we do mean supplies – many of the items
          on <a href="https://www.tubman.org/file_download/82423ac0-2720-4275-9e37-275056a07773">Tubman’s donation wish
          list</a> are everyday products a family needs, like soaps, snack bags, and diapers.</p>

        <p>Please look at their
          <a href="https://www.tubman.org/file_download/82423ac0-2720-4275-9e37-275056a07773">official donation wish
            list</a> and their <a href="https://www.tubman.org/give-help/ways-to-give/donate-goods.html">donation page</a>
          on their website.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Bring physical items as per
            <a href="https://www.tubman.org/file_download/82423ac0-2720-4275-9e37-275056a07773">Tubman’s General Wish List
              guide</a>
            (see Tubman’s donation page for additional details on what their organization is looking for)
          </li>
          <li>After registering, have an available HQ person distribute stars!
            <ul>
              <li>Receive one star for every ~$5 worth of physical items donated, to a maximum of 5 stars.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Reap the rewards in your games!
            <ul>
              <li>Pathfinder 2E: For every 1 star, you give out a hero point to players at your table (similar to a
                glyph hero point).
              </li>
              <li>Pathfinder 1E/Starfinder: For every 1 star, when you use a reroll, that reroll gets a +1 bonus.
                Maximum +5, even when adding to GM stars.
              </li>
            </ul>
        </ol>

        <h3>Auction/Raffle Item Donation</h3>

        <p>Have some gently used RPG Books or other nerd products you no longer need? We accept at-con donations for our
          silent auction and SkålCon shop. Just let HQ know you’d like to donate these items and they will set it up
          shortly thereafter. Tax-deductible receipts are available upon request.</p>
