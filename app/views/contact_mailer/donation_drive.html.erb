<h1><%= @event.name %> Physical Donation Drive!</h1>

<p>We will be running a supply drive for Tubman again this year! Please bring items as per <a href="https://tubman.org/file_download/b8f9d4f2-c099-4a98-b3f1-ebcb4bea9a5d">Tubman’s General Wish List guide</a>, which includes household supplies and certain non-perishable food items. Visit <a href="https://tubman.org/give-help/ways-to-donate/donate-goods.html?page=1">Tubman’s donation page</a> for additional details on what their organization is looking for. Each donation will receive a ‘star’ that will have in-game benefits during SkålCon! In addition, you can request a donation receipt for tax purposes if you so choose. </p>

<p>For every item you bring, you will receive a bonus:</p>

<p>1-5 food items equals a +1 to +5 on a re-roll once per session.</p>

<p>Thus, if you bring in three items Friday night, you will receive a +3 to one re-roll every session you play all weekend.</p>

<p>(note: This will not stack with yer GM Star bonus re-roll; use which ever is higher)</p>

<p>If you bring in more than five food items, you will receive a bonus to the Aid Another action! If you bring in fifteen food items, the first five go to the re-roll, and the next ten go to the Aid Another bonus for a bonus of +10 to one Aid Another once per session. This is not in addition to, but substitutes for the normal +2. Again, for every food item over five, your Aid Another bonus equals the number of food items over five.
</p>
<p>Lets bring a lot of supplies, people! Tubman's Transitional Housing is full and their new Youth Center has been full since it opened. The need is great and we can make a real, positive difference in someone's life.
</p>

<p>Thank you for making this convention a success!</p>
