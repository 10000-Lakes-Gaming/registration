<%= @event.name %> Physical Donation Drive!

We will be running a supply drive for Tubman again this year! Please bring items as per
Tubman’s General Wish List guide (https://tubman.org/file_download/b8f9d4f2-c099-4a98-b3f1-ebcb4bea9a5d),
which includes household supplies and certain non-perishable food items. Visit Tubman’s donation page
(https://tubman.org/give-help/ways-to-donate/donate-goods.html?page=1) for additional details on what their
organization is looking for.

Each donation will receive a ‘star’ that will have in-game benefits during SkålCon!
In addition, you can request a donation receipt for tax purposes if you so choose.

Every item (up to 15) will get you in game benefits!
You will receive one star to put on your badge for each item that you bring in as a donation to the
Physical Donation Drive!

Stars 1-5:  The first five items that you bring will give you a re-roll, once per session, with the
            bonus on the roll equal to the number of items you have brought (up to +5).
            Thus, if you bring in three items Friday night, you will receive a +3 to one re-roll every
            session you play all weekend. (note: This will not stack with yer GM Star bonus re-roll;
            use which ever is higher)

Stars 6-15: The next ten items will make your Aid Another actions more effective!
            Once per session, you can grant a bonus to a teammates roll equal to the number of items
            over five that you have donated. (this will not stack with the regular +2 for aid another)
            Thus, if you bring in 12 items, you will grant your teammate +7 on a single check that you
            help with the aid another action.

The need is real!

Lets bring a lot of supplies, Pathfinders! Tubman's Transitional Housing is full and their new Youth Center has been
full since it opened. The need is great and we can make a real, positive difference in someone's life.

Thank you for making this convention a success!
